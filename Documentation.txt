This is a exercise based on implementation of Linear Regression from 
scratch on Octave 4.04.

Getting Started:-
1.Download Octave;
Easily fetched from net for any OS.

2.Building Project:-
This can easily be done just by a git clone command.

3.Running on your PC:-
Just skim to your directory where it is git cloned through a 
'cd' command via Octave.

File included:-

1.weather_data.txt
2.weather_predict.m 
3.grad_des.m 
4.Cost.m
5.feature_normalize.m

Short Description:-

1.weather_data:- It is a text document that contains the dataset of 
temperatures on different days.

2.weather_predict.m :- To understand more better, it is just like a main() 
function in  C which calls other functions for their execution.

3.grad_des.m :-This is one of the core function behind Linear Regression 
Model that decides various theta(variable used) values appropriately.

4.Cost.m :- This is a Cost function which is the sum total of mean-square 
error between predicted and actual value of the model.

5.feature_normalize.m :- In this function, the input features are 
normalized and feature-scaling is applied.
